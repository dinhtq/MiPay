MiPay
========

MiPay is a soon-to-be-hopefully hybrid, mobile application that helps workers in the service industry keep track
and manage their sales and tips.

See my progress: [MiPay Demo](http://www.jasondinh.me/MiPay/app/)

Make sure you view the demo in device mode, preferably iPhone 6.

--------

MiPay is currently built using:

CLNDR.js for the calendar interface<br>
Moment.js to manage dates<br>
jQuery Mobile for mobile UI framework<br>
Chart.js as the charting library<br>


--------

Future Intentions:

The CLNDR.js library is not playing too nice with touch events.
I plan on ditching the calendar approach, and hopefully come up with some magic with
[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/)
